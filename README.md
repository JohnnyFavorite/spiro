In this project, a freely available dataset of lung function, age and height data of study participants is used to model reference
values for the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, an important lung function parameter).
My model is then compared to a number of existing reference equations (GLI 2012 reference values and Quanjer 1993).
